## Overview

The [ggFishPlots](https://deepwaterimr.github.io/ggFishPlots/) package
for [R](https://www.r-project.org/) allows quickly plotting and
calculating life history parameters required by stock assessment models.
The package uses [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference) for
plotting and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages for
calculations.

The ggOceanMaps package has been developed by the [Institute of Marine
Research](https://www.hi.no/en). Note that the package comes with
absolutely no warranty. Any [bug reports and code
fixes](https://github.com/DeepWaterIMR/ggFishPlots/issues) are warmly
welcomed. See [*Contributions*](#contributions) for further details.

If you are looking for other similar packages, make sure to check out
the
[AquaticLifeHistory](https://jonathansmart.github.io/AquaticLifeHistory/articles/Maturity_analyses.html),
[FSA](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FSA), and
[fishmethods](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fishmethods) packages,
as well as the [FishR
webpage](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/fishR/pages/packages.html).

## Installation

The most up to date version of the package can always be found from
[GitHub](https://github.com/DeepWaterIMR/ggFishPlots). If the [CRAN
version](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggFishPlots) does not work
as shown in the examples on this website, try installing the GitHub
version. You can do this by using the
[devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html)
or [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/remotes/index.html)
packages.

``` r
remotes::install_github("DeepWaterIMR/ggFishPlots")
```

## Usage

The package has a
[website](https://deepwaterimr.github.io/ggFishPlots/). At the time of
writing, the package produces four kinds of plots: [growth
curves](#growth-curves), [maturity plots](#maturity-plots),
[length-weight relationships](#length-weight-relationships), and [catch
curves](#catch-curves-to-estimate-instantaneous-total-mortality-z). Each
function returns a ggplot2 plot and the estimated parameters as a text
string that can be used in Rmarkdown and Shiny applications as well as a
data frame for further use of the parameters. The elements are returned
as a list. The package contains example data to illustrate the
functionality.

### Growth curves

Note how the `text` and `params` are returned as a list together with
`plot`.

``` r
library(ggFishPlots)

data(survey_ghl) # example data

head(survey_ghl)
#> # A tibble: 6 × 5
#>     age sex   length weight maturity
#>   <dbl> <chr>  <dbl>  <dbl>    <int>

The `text` object can be rendered to R markdown documents using the
`results = 'asis'` setting in the code chunk header
(i.e. `{r, results = 'asis'}`) and the `cat()` function after replacing
`"\n"` by `"\  n"`:

``` r
htmlcat <- function(text){
  cat(gsub(pattern = "\n", replacement = "  \n", x = text))
}

htmlcat(plot_growth(survey_ghl)$text)
```

von Bertalanffy growth function coefficients:  
Linf (asymptotic average length) = 91.2 cm +/- 88.3 - 94.6 (95% CIs)  
K (growth rate coefficient) = 0.0633 +/- 0.059 - 0.068 (95% CIs)  
t0 (age at length 0) = -3.04 (years) +/- -3.337 - -2.769 (95% CIs)  
tmax (life span; t0 + 3/K) = 44.4 years  
Number of included specimens = 10401  
Total number of measured = 618779  
Excluded (length or age missing):  
Length = 0; age = 608378

#### Split by sex

Specifying `length`, `age` and `sex` arguments have been omitted since
they are the argument names by default and the same than in the example
data. Only the `plot` element is returned this time.

``` r
plot_growth(survey_ghl, split.by.sex = TRUE)$plot
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

The dashed lines are $S_{inf}$. Data behind the growth curves are shown
as box plots by default. It is possible to plot the data as points by
defining `boxplot = FALSE`. We can also force zero group into the curves
if know the length of it. Assumed as 14 cm here. Zero group forcing
strength is 10 % of number of observations by default and can be
adjusted using the `force.zero.group.strength` argument.

``` r
plot_growth(survey_ghl, force.zero.group.length = 14, boxplot = FALSE)$plot
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

### Maturity plots

#### L50 plots

Maturity ogives are estimated using a logistic
(`family = binomial(link = "logit")`)
[`glm()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/glm)

``` r
plot_maturity(survey_ghl, length = "length", maturity = "maturity")
#> $plot
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

    #> 
    #> $text
    #> [1] "50% maturity at length (L50) based on logit regressions:\n54.784 cm. 95% confidence intervals: 52.852 - 56.787\n  Number of specimens: 64265.\n Confidence intervals estimated from the glm object."
    #> 
    #> $params
    #>       mean   ci.min ci.max  sex intercept     slope     n
    #> 1 54.78361 52.85249 56.787 both -5.755492 0.1050587 64265

The error bars represent 95% confidence intervals calculated from the
model object using the
[`confint()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/confint.html)
function and back-transformed to the original scale. The grey stepped
line is a binned average defined using the `length.bin.width` argument.

The function also contains an option to bootstrap the confidence
intervals (CIs) which will produce narrower CIs. Bootstrapping is
probably a more correct way of estimating CIs in this application. Using
only 10 replicates here to save processing time. In real application use
at least 1000.

``` r
plot_maturity(survey_ghl, bootstrap.n = 10)
#> $plot
```

    #> 1 54.77727 54.6383 54.92337 both -5.755492 0.1050587 64265

#### Split by sex

``` r
plot_maturity(survey_ghl, split.by.sex = TRUE)$plot
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

#### A50 plots

The same principle can be used to produce A50 (50% maturity at age)
plots:

``` r
plot_maturity(survey_ghl, length = "age", length.unit = "years",
              xlab = "Age", length.bin.width = 1, split.by.sex = TRUE)$plot
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Addition of juveniles

Also the `plot_maturity()` function has the option to add juveniles
(zero group fish). The addition of juveniles can be necessary for to
make the `glm()` to converge if small immature fish are scarce in the
dataset.

``` r
plot_maturity(survey_ghl, length = "age", length.unit = "years",
              xlab = "Age", length.bin.width = 1, 
              force.zero.group.length = 0,
              force.zero.group.strength = 100,
              split.by.sex = TRUE)$plot
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

Note how the addition increases the estimate for males because the
dataset did not contain a sufficient number of young males which the
number of females seems sufficient because females mature older in this
species.

One option can be to estimate the number of added juveniles using the
[`plot_catchcurve()`](#catchcurvesep) function:

``` r
plot_maturity(survey_ghl, length = "age", length.unit = "years",
              xlab = "Age", length.bin.width = 1, 
              force.zero.group.length = 0,
              force.zero.group.n = c("F" = exp(11.363), "M" = exp(11.885)),
              split.by.sex = TRUE)$plot
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

### Length-weight relationships

#### Log-linearized models

Simple plot using log-transformation and linear models by default.

``` r
plot_lw(survey_ghl, length = "length", weight = "weight")
#> $plot
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

    #> 
    #> $text

    #> 
    #> $params

The dashed lines represent 95% confidence intervals.

#### Non-linear least square models

Use non-linear least squares instead:

``` r
plot_lw(survey_ghl, use.nls = TRUE)
#> $plot

#### Split by sex

The decimal point of a and b estimates depends on the length and weight
units.
[FishBase](https://www.fishbase.se/manual/english/FishBaseThe_LENGTH_WEIGHT_Table.htm)
uses centimeters and grams. The function can correct for the units when
asked (but `length.unit` and `weight.unit` parameters have to be defined
correctly).

``` r
plot_lw(survey_ghl, split.by.sex = TRUE, correct.units = TRUE)
#> $plot
```

You can also transform the parameters according to the formulas given in
the FishBase.

``` r
plot_lw(survey_ghl %>% dplyr::mutate(weight = weight*1000), weight.unit = "g")$params
#> # A tibble: 2 × 7

#### Log-log axes to see differences

``` r
plot_lw(survey_ghl, split.by.sex = TRUE, log.axes = TRUE)$plot
```

### Catch curves to estimate instantaneous total mortality (Z)

Catch curves were added to the version 0.2.3 and may not be available in
the CRAN version. [A FishR tutorial written by Ogle
(2013)](https://www.fishbase.se/manual/english/FishBaseThe_LENGTH_WEIGHT_Table.htm)
contains a nice explanation of catch curves. At the time of writing
ggFishPlots calculates only the simple log-linearised regression.

``` r
plot_catchcurve(survey_ghl)
#> $plot
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)<!-- -->

    #> 
    #> $text

    #> 
    #> $params

The ages to be included to the Z estimation can be adjusted using the
`age.range` argument.

``` r
plot_catchcurve(survey_ghl, age.range = c(10,26))$plot
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)<!-- -->

In the plot above, -b is Z (i.e. Z = 0.356) and exp(a) (i.e. 68391) is
the number of 0 age fish assuming constant mortality.

#### Split by sex

``` r
plot_catchcurve(survey_ghl, age.range = c(10,26), split.by.sex = TRUE)$plot
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)<!-- -->

Use a named list to use separate age ranges for females and males.

``` r
tmp <- plot_catchcurve(survey_ghl,
age.range = list("F" = c(13,26), "M" = c(10,26)),
split.by.sex = TRUE)

tmp$plot
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-21-1.png)<!-- -->

Parameter estimates for the catch curve above:

``` r
htmlcat(tmp$text)
```

Instantenous total mortality (Z) estimated using a catch curve and  
age range for females and for males.

Females:  
Z = 0.37 (0.31-0.431 95% CIs)  
N at age 0 = 86119 (25990-285354 95% CIs)  
Longevity = 30.7 years (23.6 - 40.5 95% CIs)

Males:  
Z = 0.511 (0.492-0.53 95% CIs)  
N at age 0 = 145002 (105241-199785 95% CIs)  
Longevity = 23.3 years (21.8 - 24.8 95% CIs)
